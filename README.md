# ecommerce-analytics-pipeline

An end-to-end data engineering and analytics project: a Snowflake data warehouse built on a star schema, a Power BI dashboard for business reporting, and a documented query performance optimization case study.

**Dataset:** [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) (~100K orders, publicly available on Kaggle)

## What this project demonstrates

- **ELT pipeline design** — raw ingestion → staging → marts layering pattern in Snowflake
- **Dimensional modeling** — a proper star schema (1 fact table, 3 dimension tables) with verified referential integrity
- **BI reporting** — a Power BI dashboard connected live to Snowflake, with KPI cards and trend/breakdown visuals
- **Performance tuning judgment** — a controlled experiment testing warehouse sizing, clustering keys, and result caching, with real before/after numbers

## Architecture

```
Kaggle CSVs → Snowflake Internal Stage → RAW tables → STAGING views → MARTS (star schema) → Power BI
```

- **RAW**: six tables loaded directly from staged CSVs (`orders`, `order_items`, `customers`, `products`, `payments`, `sellers`)
- **STAGING**: cleaned, typed views with light standardization (null handling, category defaults)
- **MARTS**: `fact_orders` (grain: one row per order item) joined to `dim_customer`, `dim_product`, and `dim_date`

## Dashboard highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Monthly revenue trend
- Top 10 product categories by revenue
- Revenue breakdown by customer state
- KPI cards: total revenue, distinct order count, average delivery time

## Optimization case study

Full write-up in [`case_study.md`](./case_study.md). Key findings:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Warehouse sizing (XS vs. Medium) | Medium was **not faster** (988ms vs. 883ms) — 4x the cost for no benefit at this data scale |
| Clustering key | No measurable effect, because the table fits in a single micro-partition — a useful negative result |
| Result caching | Identical repeat query ran **4.7x faster** (278ms → 59ms) with zero compute cost |

The takeaway: not every optimization technique applies at every data scale, and confirming *why* something doesn't help is as valuable as finding something that does.

## Orchestration (Apache Airflow)

To move this project beyond one-off SQL scripts, the staging → marts pipeline is orchestrated with Apache Airflow, running locally via Docker Compose.

**DAG: `ecommerce_analytics_pipeline`**
- **Schedule:** Daily
- **11 tasks** spanning three stages:
  1. **Staging refresh** (5 parallel tasks) — rebuilds `stg_orders`, `stg_order_items`, `stg_customers`, `stg_products`, `stg_payments` as views over raw data
  2. **Marts rebuild** (3 tasks) — rebuilds `dim_customer`, `dim_product`, and `fact_orders`, each depending on its corresponding staging view
  3. **Data quality gates** (3 tasks) — row-count sanity check on `fact_orders`, plus orphan-key checks confirming every order references a valid customer and product before the pipeline is considered successful

**Scope boundary:** This DAG orchestrates staging → marts only. Raw ingestion (loading the Olist CSVs into Snowflake via `COPY INTO`) is treated as a one-time historical load, simulating a real-world scenario where upstream ingestion is owned by a separate process or team, and this DAG picks up from there.

**Why Airflow over just running the SQL scripts manually:**
- Dependency management — marts tasks only run after their staging view is confirmed rebuilt, not just "after some SQL ran"
- Automated data quality gating — a bad load surfaces immediately as a failed task rather than a silent downstream inconsistency
- Retry logic and observability — failed tasks retry automatically, and every run's duration/status is logged and visible in the UI
- Scheduling — this can run daily/hourly without manual intervention, matching how a production analytics pipeline would actually operate

**Setup:**
```bash
cd airflow
docker compose up -d
```
Then visit `localhost:8080` (default credentials: `airflow`/`airflow`) and trigger the `ecommerce_analytics_pipeline` DAG.

## Notes

- No fabricated metrics — all numbers in `case_study.md` come directly from Snowflake's Query Profile on this exact dataset.
- The `.pbix` file requires Power BI Desktop (Windows) or the Power BI web app to open; the screenshot is included for quick viewing.
